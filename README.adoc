= Application Server for GO (ASG)

ASG is application server for Golang, which makes it possible to process distributed transactions in Golang. It is possible to reload the application components without service interruption. Basically system is service oriented where server components advertises services (service is just a literal name like "GETBALANCE", "TRXREQ", etc.), then later these services are called by client binaries. Clients and servers can be located on different physical machines and they can call each other with out knowledge of their psychical location. As these server binaries are stateless, they can be started in multiple copies. This ensures fault tolerant processing. Clients and Server Services comunicate via middleware which supports three kind of buffers for request/response data: 1) Arbitrary string 2) Byte array 3) Unified Buffer Format (UBF)

== Foundation

ASG is built on Enduro/X middleware framework, which by itself implements extended XATMI specification. For distributed transaction processing XA API is used. XA must be supported by underlaying SQL (or any other resource) driver. The platform is build on GNU/Linux technology and it utilizes Posix kernel queues for gaining high IPC throughput.

Before try to build ASG, you need to install Enduro/X Middleware Platform, https://github.com/endurox-dev/endurox

== Buffer Types

=== String buffer
It is possible to send to services arbitrary strings. These could be JSON, XML or whatever data. The service might respond with the same buffer format, with changed contents. 

=== Byte array (Carray)
It is possible to send to services byte arrays. The data could include binary zeros.

=== Unified Buffer Format buffer
UBF buffer basically is hash-list where for each value there could be array of elements (e.g. one or more). The buffer is typed. Fields are predefined in field definition tables, later with Enduro/X's 'mkfldhdr -m1' can be generated field constant tables which provides go format.

=== JSON buffer
JSON Text format buffer is supported. This can be used to call Enduro/X server or receive JSON format calls from the system.

== XA SQL Drivers
Currently Enduro/X supports Oracle DB OCI driver. The patched version for XA processing is available here: https://github.com/endurox-dev/go-oci8. When doing processing in XA mode, the connection string must be empty ("").

== Documentation
Please refer to Enduro/X documentation located here: https://github.com/endurox-dev/endurox/tree/master/doc (e.g. getting_started_tutorial.adoc, building_guide.adoc, etc.) Basic ASG application layout can be checked out from this repository "tests" folder.
