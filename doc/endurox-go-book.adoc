== Introduction

This module is set of objects that are binded to Enduro/X C based framework. 
Enduro/X by it self is middleware that uses operating system kernel queues for 
doing high performance inter-process communication. The middleware functionality 
is in the heart of the Enduro/X. Other functionality that comes in the package
is application server, which boots up the processes, monitors them (restarts is
they become dead), detects stalled services.

The processes in Enduro/X are split into to categories:

1. Client processes

2. Server processes

The client processes might be a stand alone process (executables running in system)
or it can be controlled by Enduro/X's Client Process Monitor (cpmsrv). Which gives
administrator nice interface for configuring/starting/stopping the clients.

The server processes are ones that are started by Enduro/X local daemon process
called 'ndrxd'. The server process have inside a thread which conforms the XATMI
server process workflow. At the startup the init function is called. Then threads
goes into waiting on message dispatches (waits on Posix queues). 

Once the application server is going for shutdown or administrator is about to
shutdown single server, then XATMI server process is notified of this action
and server process can gracefully do the de-init and shutdown. The uninit callback
is send to server process while doing shutdown.


== API Model

The Enduro/X API object oriented where the main Enduro/X objects are held into Go
structures. List of methods are binded to the structures. Here is the main model
of the Go API:
